## Create GUID for Visual Studio Code
Create GUID is an extension for Visual Studio Code that adds a command which can be used to generate GUIDs.

## Guide
After installing this extension you can create new GUIDs by brining up the command prompt (F1) and typing Create GUID.  When this command is executed it will generate a new version 4 UUID and copy it to your clipboard where you can then paste it wherever you like.

## About

This extension uses the [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid) package to generate GUIDs and the [copy-paste](https://github.com/xavi-/node-copy-paste) package to copy values to the clipboard.
